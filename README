Some basic examples of how to use three.js

View the source of http://ryan-kahn.com/threejs/phase1.html and http://ryan-kahn.com/threejs/phase2.html to see how things were built. These examples are currently using the canvas and not webGL simply because I wanted to show people on my phone.

The main page(http://ryan-kahn.com/threejs/) is an example of some advanced usage and my attempts at creating a game similar to Coign of Vantage (http://www.miniclip.com/games/coign-of-vantage/en/) however, I did not spend the time figuring out the 3d math for this one.
